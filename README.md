## Introduction

The National Football League (NFL) Combine is the yearly gathering of approximately 300 invited top
football athletes applying to play for one of the 32 NFL professional football teams.  Preceding and during the Combine,
coaches and recruiters measure and test each athlete to access their physical attributes and skills.  These physical
attributes include height, weight, arm length, and hand size.  Physical skills include running speed (ten yards, twenty yards, 
and forty yards), agility (twentyss and threecone), jumping (broad and vertical), and weightlifting (bench).  Different 
physical attributes and skills are recognized as having more importance to one or more of the 22 different
football player positions in the NFL draft. Because of the diversity in the original data set, the focus of this analysis
is on the wide receiver positionto determine which physical attributes and skills in a published combine data
set correlate to the actual drafted wide receiver athletes from the 1999 – 2015 combine years.

The original data set contains close to 5000 observations for the 22 football player positions for the 1999-2015 combine years. 
This data set is statistically a challenge to assess because the data is missing for different measurements, for different years, 
and for different player positions.  A zero or null in almost all cases in this data set means that the coaches did not need or record
the value, like the hand measurement, and not that the player could not jump ten inches.  A nonzero value in our response variable, 
picktotal, means that the player was drafted. The lowest nonzero picktotal values indicate the more highly recruited players.

Also, the value and significance of some measurements is quite different for one player position versus another player position. 
For instance, wide receivers, who run to catch passes, and the cornerbacks, who defend against those passes, need to be very fast. 
In contrast, linemen, who protect the quarterback for that pass, need to be heavy and strong.  Linemen are almost a second slower in 
the 40 yard dash than wide receivers or cornerbacks. Both are world class athletes, but no wide receiver will ever get drafted 
into the NFL with a lineman’s 40 yard dash time.
